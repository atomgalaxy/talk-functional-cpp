# Functional C++

C++ is a multiparadigm language. It supports generic programming, functional
programming, procedural programming, and object-oriented programming.
Functional programming is the least well supported; but it is possible to make it much better.

If you want to explore what it would take to make C++ amazing at functional
programming, this talk is for you! We will delve into what it would take to
make calling functions symmetric from returning from functions, and how that
relates to implementing proper functional programming in C++.

Hope to see you there!
